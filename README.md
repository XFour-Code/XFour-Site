### History
I first registered the http://benjisoft.org.uk domain back in 2016. This definitely was not the first domain I ever purchased! That was way back in 2013!

Since then, it has been through 3 iterations. The first being a template! The second a site that was built from the ground up but had a horrific colour scheme! This is the 3rd and hopefully the best!

We have recently changed our neame to now being called XFour after registering the domain http://xfour.co.uk/ in 2018. This was one of many changes to the running of this business after changing the name from BenjiSoft to XFour.
